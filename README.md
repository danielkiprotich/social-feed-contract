# Patient Record Access System

## Overview

This ICP smart contract allows Patient to manage access to their medical History to doctors and hospitals. It manages doctors and their assignments to hospitals, and patient-doctor interactions. It has functions to update patient history and assign patients to doctors. The error handling is expanded to cover unauthorized access and payload validation issues. The Candid interface is updated to reflect the changes in functionality.

## 1. Struct Definitions

### Doctor

- **Attributes:**
  - `id`, `name`, `password`, `hospital_id`, `patient_ids`.
- Represents information about a doctor involved in the blood donation drive.

### PatientHistoryUpdate

- **Attributes:**
  - `doctor_id`, `patient_id`, `doctor_password`, `new_history`.
- Represents a payload structure for updating a patient's medical history.

### EditDoctor

- **Attributes:**
  - `name`, `doctor_id`, `hospital_id`, `doctor_password`, `hospital_password`.
- Represents a payload structure for editing doctor attributes.

### DoctorPayload

- **Attributes:**
  - `name`, `hospital_id`, `password`, `hospital_password`.
- Represents a payload structure for adding a new doctor.

## 2. Additional Storage

- Introduces a new `DOCTOR_STORAGE` using `StableBTreeMap` to store doctor-related information.

## 3. Update Functions

### assign_patient_to_doctor

- Assigns a patient to a doctor and adds the patient to the doctor's hospital.

### update_patient_history

- Updates a patient's medical history by a doctor.

### add_doctor

- Adds a new doctor to the system.

### add_doctor_to_hospital

- Helper function to add a doctor to a hospital.

### edit_doctor

- Edits doctor attributes and assigns the doctor to a hospital.

## 4. Query Functions

### get_doctor_by_id

- Retrieves a doctor by ID.

### get_patient_info

- Retrieves patient information by patient ID and doctor password.

## 5. Helper Functions

### add_doctor_to_storage

- Helper function to add a doctor to storage.

### add_patient_to_hospital

- Helper function to add a patient to a hospital.

## 6. Error Handling

- Extends the `Error` enum with new variants (`AlreadyInit`, `Unauthorized`).

## 7. Candid Interface

- Exports the Candid interface for seamless interaction with the Internet Computer.

- [SDK Developer Tools](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/developers-guide/sdk-guide)
- [Rust Canister Devlopment Guide](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/rust-guide/rust-intro)

- [JavaScript API Reference](https://erxue-5aaaa-aaaab-qaagq-cai.raw.icp0.io)

If you want to start working on your project right away, you might want to try the following commands:

```bash
cd social_feeds/
dfx help
dfx canister --help
```

## Running the project locally

If you want to test your project locally, you can use the following commands:

```bash
# Starts the replica, running in the background
dfx start --background

# Deploys your canisters to the replica and generates your candid interface
dfx deploy
```

Once the job completes, your application will be available at `http://localhost:4943?canisterId={asset_canister_id}`.

If you have made changes to your backend canister, you can generate a new candid interface with

```bash
npm run generate
```

at any time. This is recommended before starting the frontend development server, and will be run automatically any time you run `dfx deploy`.

If you are making frontend changes, you can start a development server with

```bash
npm start
```

Which will start a server at `http://localhost:8080`, proxying API requests to the replica at port 4943.

### Note on frontend environment variables

If you are hosting frontend code somewhere without using DFX, you may need to make one of the following adjustments to ensure your project does not fetch the root key in production:

- set`DFX_NETWORK` to `production` if you are using Webpack
- use your own preferred method to replace `process.env.DFX_NETWORK` in the autogenerated declarations
  - Setting `canisters -> {asset_canister_id} -> declarations -> env_override to a string` in `dfx.json` will replace `process.env.DFX_NETWORK` with the string in the autogenerated declarations
- Write your own `createActor` constructor
